For this assignment you are to use a specific facility that reported data for 2022 to the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI).
You must choose a facility with the last two digits in their NPRI id corresponding to the last two digits of your UW id. For example, if your UW i.d. is 2234290, then there are approximately 50 facilities in the database whose number ends with “90”.
For your benefit, a list of all facilities reporting in 2022, sorted by NPRI id is provided in LEARN.
Facilities are off-limits if they are used as examples in the course. Please exclude any Toyota facility (including the one above), Krug Furniture, Brampton Brick, Oregon Tool Canada, any facility in Waterloo, and any facility in the electricity sector.
Otherwise, choose a facility that helps you satisfy the expectations of each point of the assignment.
Q1
For your selected facility consider “industry” in the IIT framework.  a) Identify your select facility.b) Describe the industry in which your facility operates, including NAICS code, the size and scope of the industry in Canada, and where the industry operates in Canada. c) For your facility, describe the owner, including how it is owned, for example whether it is owned by, managed by or related to a larger company or to a municipality. Give the main website if available.d) Identify (or speculate) on the products and/or services of the facility. Be as specific as possible. Provide production data if available.For NAICS code, place your industry within one of the 18 distinct industrial sector classifications used by NPRI, but consider that a 代 写Assignment A1 – ENBUS 202 – Fall 2024Prolog

Reference the NPRI website and any other sources you use.· 20 points· Answer in fewer than 400 words, not including references.· You can write in full sentences or present your answer in a table or in bullet form.· References in APA.
Q2

For your selected facility consider “issues” as defined in the IIT framework.  a) Identify your select facility and its pollutantsb) Describe issues associated with pollutants reported by the facility – ensure your facility has reported at least three pollutants to NPRI. c) Compare the pollutants reported by the facility and consider which one presents the greatest concern to the environment. And why?
If the facility has a long list, you don’t necessarily need to name each pollutant – consider the types and categories of substances.
When regarding greatest concern consider at least:- Where the substance goes.- What environmental media (air, water, soil, etc.) are affected.- What harm the pollutant may cause to people or ecosystems (i.e., adverse impacts).- That different substances pose different hazards.
Use information from the Government of Canada (e.g., Environment and Climate Change Canada or NPRI) and from at least one other source external to the Government of Canada. Reference the NPRI website and any other sources you use.· 20 points· Answer in fewer than 400 words, not including references.· You can write in full sentences or present your answer in a table or in bullet form.· Note that you should be looking at pollutant releases (to the environment), not off-site transfers.· Points will be deducted for discussing greenhouse gas emissions.· References in APA.
Q3

For one pollutant associated with your facility:a) Draw an original graph that plots the trend of facility emissions over time. Use data for at least three years to make this meaningful. You can add 2023 data here (which are not yet final). Include a title for the figure.b) Discuss the trend and scale of your facility’s emission of the pollutant. Compare your facility to other facilities and to total emissions in Canada. Is your facility a big polluter? Is it improving?· 20 points· Answer using two figures (one graph), each on a separate page.· Each figure must have a clear and concise title.· Answer b) in fewer than 200 words, not including references.· References in APA.
